When we see any image, our brain instantly recognizes the objects contained in it. On the other hand, it takes a lot of time and training data for a machine to identify these objects. 

It is through this that self-driving cars safely navigate through traffic and findsway in crowded place.
Object Detection is one of the important part of computer vision whether we need to detect traffic light, cars or people.And this is just a bit of thing that object detection technology can do!

Is always good to start with pretrained models like RetinaNet , YOLOv3 ,TinyYOLOv3 ,etc...

Can download models from the links below : 

RetinaNet : https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/1.0/resnet50_coco_best_v2.0.1.h5
YOLOv3 : https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/1.0/yolo.h5
TinyYOLOv3 : https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/1.0/yolo-tiny.h5

Once you download the object detection model file,one should copy the model file to project folder where one is creating .py files.Then create a python file and give it a name; an example is ObjectDetection.py.
